                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Our co-founder John Fabricius began campaigning for independent prison oversight just after his release from prison in August 2018. Volunteering with American Friends Service Committee-Arizona in Tucson, John and other dedicated volunteers advocated tirelessly on oversight.</p>
                    <p>After the Lewis Lock event broke and Director Charles Ryan suddenly retired the day before a damning report was issued by the governor, John wrote oversight legislation that was sponsored by Rep. Diego Rodriguez (D).</p>
                    <p>In 2020, we formed Arizonans for Transparency and Accountability in Corrections (ATAC) and began working on oversight exclusively. In 2024, we rebranded as Praxis Initiative to reflect an expanded mission that now includes criminal legal system reform, drug policy & overdose prevention, returning-citizen civics & advocacy training, and arts-in-prison programs.</p>
